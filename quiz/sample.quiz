notes about text-quiz's .quiz quiz files:
each question MUST HAVE 6 LINES! this includes 4 answer choice lines, 
1 answer line, and one question. (see above and below)
the questions start on line 3.
after the last question donâ€™t forget "DONE" as above. this instructs text-quiz that the quiz is over.

any questions? need help? drop me a line!

in the space after "DONE" feel free to add anything relevant. such as: license notices, copyright, notes to user, 
about author.  stuff like that. the script stops reading the file after it receives DONE as a question header (see below)
